<div class="entry-content"><p>My taste in books spans far and wide. With the single exception of westerns, I&rsquo;ll read any genre. Romance? Yep, been there. (A few writers actually do a wonderful job here.) Sci-fi? Call Mom and tell her I won&rsquo;t be home tonight. Fantasy? Wee.</p>

<p>As I descend into book-alcoholism, I consider myself a bit of a book matchmaker. I try to set up my friends with certain books. As with romantic partner, there&rsquo;s a book out there for everyone.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that nowadays, genres&rsquo;s predictive power of reader interest is declining. In other words, no longer can a sic-fi buff pick up a new sci-fi book and be certain that he (or she) will appreciate the book.</p>

<p>I suspect it&rsquo;s because genres don&rsquo;t quite capture the appeal of certain books to some readers. I propose a new way of classifying books that capture the book&rsquo;s allure.</p>

<p>I see three different engines that drive different novels:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>World-driven</strong>: the world becomes the book&rsquo;s main attraction. Authors usually spend pages and pages detailing the nooks and crannies of this new, foreign world. The world determines the plot and characters, not the other way around.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plot-driven</strong>: the plot capiviates and captures the reader. Some strange sequence of events propel the characters towards the climax.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character-driven</strong>: the character&mdash;his or her development, actions, reactions&mdash;is the novel. The world and plot become secondary to the intimate study of people.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All novels have a main engine. A world-driven novel can have  an exciting plot, but the world remains the essence of the novel. Likewise for the other categories.</p>

<p>Now, the question arises: why should we care?</p>

<p>As more novels transcend or mix genres, cookie-cutter labels no longer serve as reliable indicator of reader interest. Some &ldquo;science fiction&rdquo; books are primarily character-driven, leading to some disappointment by readers who value world-building over character development.</p>

<p>Some key differences arise among the categories:</p>

<h3>World-driven books focus more on the environment, rather than the characters.</h3>

<p>By necessity, world-driven books wax endless about the world around the protagonists. This can lead to slow-moving books, and, in the hands of an unskilled writer, stock characters.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Snow Crash</em> (Neal Stephenson): this may be the perfect example of a world-driven novel. Stephenson takes us for a wild ride through a futuristic L.A. County. Currently, I&rsquo;m 45% way through the novel and the plot has barely begun. For readers who prefer quicker-moving books or character development, this book ain&rsquo;t it.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em> (Haruki Murakami): a wonderful cyberpunk thriller that combines plot and world-building beautifully. Still, this book leaves character development at the door.</p></li>
<li><p><em>1984</em> (George Orwell): like most dystopian fiction,  <em>1984</em> focuses heavily on the machinations of the thought police and Oceania. Winston Smith serves as a template, showing Big Brother&rsquo;s tyranny.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All these examples lay with the greats of the greats of literature. World-driven books, in many ways, require more raw creativity than the other two classes. The writer has to devise an original, internally consistent world. That takes real creativity and brainpower.</p>

<p>Certain genres favor this kind of book, such as science fiction, fantasy and dystopias, since these genres are &ldquo;speculative.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t be fooled. More &ldquo;literary&rdquo; books such as <em>Lord of Flies</em> (William Golding) has a world-driven engine.</p>

<h3>Plot-driven novels depend on external events to move along the novel.</h3>

<p>Plot consists of events that &ldquo;defines&rdquo; a story. Plot bears very different relationship to the characters and the worlds in different novels. In World-driven novels, the world defines the plot. (Think <em>1984</em> and Winston&rsquo;s efforts to join the Brotherhood). Conversely,  in character-driven novels, characters make the plot possible. (Think: <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and the rejection scene, followed by Lydia&rsquo;s mishaps.)</p>

<p>Plots work differently in plot-driven works. Plot encapsulates the book itself. It may be more useful to look at examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> (Alexandre Dumas):  the engine of this book is Edmond Dantes&#8217; false imprisonment. Without the treachery of Danglars, Fernand and Villefort, no book would exist. The &ldquo;world&rdquo; is otherwise normal: post-Napoleonic France.  The 19-year-old Edmond Dantes proves too naive and unworldly to drive the novel.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> (Stieg Larsson): this premise shocks and enthralls. A woman missing for decades and a sadistic rapist. Even though Mikael Blomvist and Lisbeth Salander are the protagonists, the book isn&rsquo;t truly about them. The book focuses on the strange events of the Vanger family.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Lord of the Rings</em> (J.R. R. Tolkein): I debated whether this series fit the world or the plot-driven category. I think it&rsquo;s more plot-driven since it focuses on Frodo&rsquo;s journey to Mount Doom. The mission to destroy the Ring defines every single character (and the world as well).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You see, these books lean on the thrilling, exciting side. If one likes plot-driven novels, that generally means one likes snappy, fast-paced books. (Nothing wrong with that!)</p>

<p>Oftentimes, plot-driven novels skimp on character development because the characters serve the plot, not the other way around. A skilled writer, however, can weave character development into the plot.</p>

<h3>Character-driven novels focus on the characters: their foibles, follies and triumphs.</h3>

<p>Character-driven novels occupy a far corner away from the world and plot-driven novels.  These novels become intimate psychological portrait of a single person (or a few people).</p>

<p>Oftentimes, these books lag and dawdle behind their cohorts. The authors must focus a good chunk of their novel to characterization, development and closure. Sometimes, these novels meander since the characters&mdash;usually quirky and eccentric&mdash;sit in the driver&rsquo;s seat (and they may not drive well). The novel&rsquo;s journey isn&rsquo;t in the events themselves, but in the character development.</p>

<p>Notable examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (Jane Austen): Elizabeth&rsquo;s growth from a prejudiced, sometimes judgmental and willfully blind woman to a more level-headed (but still feisty) woman encompasses the entire novel. Mr. Darcy and her wrong-headed views of each other make the entire rejection scene possible.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Barney&rsquo;s Version</em> (Mordecai Richler): Barney struggles with his worst nemesis: himself. This novel tells a story of an degenerate ingrate grabbing the small happiness that he can, then destroying it. A wonderful, engaging character portrait.</p></li>
<li><p><em>She&rsquo;s Come Undone</em> (Wally Lamb): a heart-wrenching story of a woman struggling with mental illness. This story takes us from Dolores Price&rsquo;s humble beginnings through her struggles with herself and her tenable peace.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Character-driven novels, of course, need characters envelopment. Otherwise, the novel has failed at its entire premise. Books focusing on character development may not excite or enthrall the senses and imagination as much, but they are indeed a worthy read. In the hands of a great author, humanity reveals itself.</p>

<h3>So…</h3>

<p>You can find all three types in every genre. Of course, some genres favor one type over others. Literature and books today bend and stretch conventional tropes, making genres a less useful predictor for taste.</p>

<p>For example, <em>Graceling</em> shifts the typical world-driven focus of fantasy novels, preferring the character-driven engine. I found it an engaging read, but not all readers did. They have a point. Graceling skimps on world-building, something some readers value above all else. The Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire&rsquo;s first book) also provides an interesting example of a genre-busting book. There&rsquo;s definitely plot in Games of Thrones, but I think it&rsquo;s far more character-driven than a typical fantasy, with a wide web of character motivations driving the plot forward.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand the type of novel you prefer. That way, you waste less time with novels that simply don&rsquo;t meet your taste. You can find literature and pure art in all three categories.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to abolish genres completely. They serve useful purposes. I want, however, people to truly think about what attracts them to a certain type of book. Is it the world? The plot? Or perhaps, the characters? As noted in the comments with <a href="http://www.quora.com/Monika-Kothari">Monika Kothari</a>, the most ideal use of this categorization would be as a sub-genre. For example, the main genre would be &ldquo;Fantasy&rdquo; sub-divided into world, plot and character-driven categories.</p>

<p>Alas, there will be books that fall somewhere in-between the categories.</p>

<p>Me? I like them all.</p>
