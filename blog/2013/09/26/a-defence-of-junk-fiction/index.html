<div class="entry-content"><p>Hi, my name is Cristina. I am a junk fiction lover. Nice to meet you.</p>

<p>My reading taste vacillates somewhere between a slightly raised middlebrow to a droopy lowbrow, depending on my mood. (Right now, it&rsquo;s in the lower half.) Whatever my mood may be, I am always a fan of junk fiction.</p>

<p>Junk fiction isn&rsquo;t a real genre, but it&rsquo;s what I call books that has a vocabulary that hovers above a fifth-grade level and will never win any literary awards. They are oftentimes formulaic and employ hackneyed plot devices. In other words, these are the books that you&rsquo;re at least a bit embarrassed to admit reading among your well-educated and well-read peers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m here to defend these books. They may be a little trashy, but they are worthwhile.</p>

<h3>Junk Fiction as a Gateway Drug</h3>

<p>Junk fiction, true to its name, appeals to our less refined tastes and is easy to consume. When the most challenging word in the book is motherfucker, you don&rsquo;t need to keep your dictionary nearby. With these formulaic plot lines, you can breeze through a book in a day or two.</p>

<p>Maybe, in this case, a low nutritional content is a good thing.</p>

<p>Let me tell you how I got into reading grown-up books. When I made my first tentative steps from the YA stacks in the library to the big, scary adult section, I didn&rsquo;t know where to start. As a 11-year-old, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to choose books so I simply looked at the top 100 books and chose the one with the coolest cover. Well, I began with A Portrait of a Lady, and gave up after 20 pages. I slunk back to the YA section, convinced that I wasn&rsquo;t grown-up enough and re-read A Face on the Milk Carton for the umpteenth time.</p>

<p>A year later, I gathered up my courage and ventured back into the grown-up books section. This time I picked up a Clive Clusser book. (Cool cover, bro.) I loved it and read some more. They were easy to read, action-packed, and didn&rsquo;t constantly confuse me.</p>

<p>From Clive Clusser, I graduated to Dean Koontz, Stephen King, John Grisham, Robert Ludlum, and I think Dan Brown made an appearance. With these writers, my vocabulary expanded, my ability to follow more complex plots improved, and my confidence in my reading abilities skyrocketed.</p>

<p>So, I moved onto the harder stuff: Steinbeck, Garcia Marquez, Nabokov, the Bronte Sisters, Austen, among others. I doubt I would have been able to bear 100 Years of Solitude with its dozens of Aurelianos and irregular chronology without my background in junk fiction.</p>

<p>Of course, this is all anecdotal evidence and wouldn&rsquo;t pass snuff even at the most drug-addled review panel. Now we&rsquo;ll talk about harder things like facts and statistics.</p>

<p>In the age of junky YA fiction like Twilight, The Hunger Games, not to mention the whole paranormal thang, the future of reading may seem dim. Yet, teens and young adults (between the ages of 16 and 29) read far more than their older peers.[1][2] I suspect that they&rsquo;re not all reading James Joyce, but they&rsquo;re reading stuff like Fifty Shades of Grey and paranormal adventures.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is a bad thing at all. I think it&rsquo;s great. Books like Twilight and The Hunger Games, are a great introduction to the wide world of literature. Once teens read these books, they will see that books can be fun and cool to read. Some of them will even take bold steps further into the  literary world into more difficult reads like Austen and, god forbid it, Cormac McCarthy.</p>

<p>As they say, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. That being said, by slowly increasing the amount of vinegar in honey, maybe you can teach the fly to like vinegar.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone will make the transition from junk fiction to the harder stuff. That&rsquo;s okay. Not everyone is cut out to read Infinite Jest on the bus ride to work. You know, a lot of pot users never graduate to LSD, cocaine, or the harder stuff&hellip;they&rsquo;re just there for the soft buzz. Quite frankly, these folks would never have come close to Tolstoy anyway, no matter how much honey you pour on Anna Karenina.</p>

<h3>The Value of Simple Entertainment</h3>

<p>Junk fiction serves a even loftier purpose than serving as a gateway drug: it entertains.</p>

<p>In certain circles, people look down on books, movies, and activities that are entertaining for the sake of entertainment. I think they feel like a human mind should constantly run on full capacity. If you slip and read a sentence from a Dan Brown book, your life will be ruined.</p>

<p>You know, sometimes it&rsquo;s fun just to have&hellip;fun.</p>

<p>I can cite research saying that fun is important to things like success, brain functioning, sex drive&hellip;whatever, but that&rsquo;d be capitulating to the incessant push to improve ourselves.[3] All I know is that I hate the feeling of having to be running on every cylinder at all times. Sometimes I just want to relax, bro.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about today&rsquo;s literary world is that, no matter your taste, you can find a book that tickles your fancy. Be it lowbrow swords-and-dagger romance, or teenage fantasies about hot vampires, you have an opportunity to escape our stressful realities.</p>

<p>I just wanna have fun sometimes, y&#8217;know? Being deep is hard and stuff.</p>
