<div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago, I talked about <a href="/blog/2013/04/09/how-to-get-feedback-on-your-writing-or-other-stuff">How to Get Feedback on Your Writing</a>. One of the cardinal suggestions was to provide good feedback, but I neglected to explain how.</p>

<p>Let me rectify that oversight.</p>

<p>Giving feedback is a skill worth developing, particularly in creative endeavors where good feedback can take something from mediocre to awesome. Good feedback doesn&rsquo;t just benefit the recipient; it benefits the provider as well. Giving good, cogent feedback on others&#8217; work will sharpen your assessment of your own work. Plus, giving terrible feedback just may earn you an enemy, rather than a friend.</p>

<p>So, it&rsquo;s win-win.</p>

<p>My advice will focus mostly on writers and writing, but I hope it can be generalized to other creative areas.</p>

<p><strong>Tailor your feedback to the stage of the project.</strong></p>

<p>There are two basic types of feedback in writing: meta-level and micro-level types. Meta-level feedback pertain to &ldquo;big idea&rdquo; issues like plot, structure and character development. Micro-level feedback has more to do with prose: sentence structure, word flow, and voice.</p>

<p>Both types of feedback are crucial to writers, but their helpfulness depend on the timing. Picking out typos or grammar mishaps is probably a waste of time in a first draft since these sentences may not survive the subsequent redrafting. Meta-level feedback can be harmful at the latest stages of a work, since it may instill doubt and needless redrafting by the writer. Timing matters.</p>

<p>Projects that are in the early stages of development benefit the most from meta-level feedback; late-stage projects get the polish it needs from micro-level feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Understand the project&rsquo;s context and objectives.</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more frustrating than getting feedback that missed or misunderstood the context or objective of my writing. The feedback ends up being worse than useless. It wastes time on two sides: the giver&rsquo;s and the receiver&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Fictional works geared towards young adults require a different set of criteria and concerns than works aimed at adults. To give good feedback, you need to understand what the writer&rsquo;s goal and audience are. Otherwise, you may lead them astray by accident.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, that means you&rsquo;ll need to ask questions before you start commenting.</p>

<p><strong>Be clear and precise in your feedback.</strong></p>

<p>This goes for both positive and negative feedback.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I liked it! It was nice!&rdquo; is always nice to hear, but isn&rsquo;t terribly helpful. I&rsquo;m unclear what you liked about my story. It could be anything: the prose, the plot, the cute guy on page 88. &ldquo;I liked how the story looped back to the beginning. It gave me a lot of closure,&rdquo; is a lot more helpful (and gratifying).</p>

<p>Likewise, &ldquo;The father&rsquo;s outburst is weird. I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; is less than helpful. &ldquo;The father&rsquo;s outburst seems like it came out of nowhere and isn&rsquo;t well-developed,&rdquo; works much better. The latter gives me something I can work with, a goal. The former doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Clarity and precision in your feedback allows the recipient to figure out what your feedback means. General feedback usually end up sounding like personal, subjective opinions which can be easily discarded.</p>

<p>Of course, clarity and precision will take hard work and some thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Treat feedback as a conversation rather than a lecture.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes when I get feedback, I&rsquo;ll think to myself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that.&rdquo; So I counter with my own opinion of the particular segment.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t do this to be an egoistical jerk (I pinky swear). I argue a bit with a reader to see if the feedback is reliable and consistent. Sometimes, readers will miss a key detail that I included that changes their opinion or interpretation. If so, I will either disregard the feedback or think about making the detail more prominent. If, however, the reader simply slinks off and sulks, I usually don&rsquo;t take their feedback seriously. It ended up feeling like someone was lecturing me, but that someone was completely unlearned in that subject.</p>

<p>As a writer, I&rsquo;ve found the best feedback to come <em>after</em> a conversation with a reader. Sometimes the conversation gleans deeper insight than the original piece of feedback. It also led to a nice friendship.</p>

<p>At the end, it takes two to create a great critique experience: the provider and the recipient.</p>
