<div class="entry-content"><p>As of late, a lot of people have been asking questions about authenticity on Quora.[1][2][3] (Full disclosure: I&rsquo;m one of the askers.)</p>

<p>There is a vague sense that &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; is important. But we don&rsquo;t quite know what it is. Some will say that it&rsquo;s factual accuracy. Others will say that it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;rightness&rdquo; of the point of view (if that can even be quantified). An even smaller minority will say that it has to <em>feel</em> right.</p>

<p>We just know it&rsquo;s <em>important</em>. So important that many writers spend their lives searching for authenticity/accuracy under history books, rocks, tables and beds. J.R.R. Tolkien created his own language, for god&rsquo;s sake.  Some of them never find it. Some writers just ooze authenticity without opening a single damn book.</p>

<p>If you ask me, I think authenticity is important, but I also think that it isn&rsquo;t what we think it is.</p>

<h3>Fiction writers write fiction, not nonfiction.</h3>

<p>This statement may seem self-evident, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>Too many writers chase accuracy as the holy grail. They believe that once they find accuracy, they will have a great story. They look for it everywhere: in the closest, under the bed, on a ship that sails around the world. Unfortunately, many of them conflate <em>accuracy</em> with <em>authenticity</em>.</p>

<p>An accurate story does not a good story make. An accurate story in its purest sense is nonfiction. Maybe the characters are fictional, bu everything else is nonfiction. These writers are writing in the wrong genre.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love a good nonfiction, but the genre dosen&rsquo;t serve the same purpose as fiction.Nonfiction tells a story that has happened. Fiction tells a story that has not happened and will most likely never happen.</p>

<p>Because an author gets a few facts wrong&mdash;or even creates a few plot holes&mdash;does not mean that his or her story is a bad story. It just means that it&rsquo;s not nonfiction. If you&rsquo;re reading a story for the factual accuracy, you&rsquo;re in the wrong aisle of the bookstore.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that fiction occupies in a different plane than nonfiction, authenticity and accuracy serve an important purpose. They, however, serve <em>different</em> purposes.</p>

<h3>A story must be accurate enough for the reader to suspend their disbelief.</h3>

<p>Every fictional story asks the recipient to &ldquo;suspend disbelief.&rdquo; This kind request only goes so far.</p>

<p>If a novel purports to be a historical novel of Regency England, you&rsquo;d raise an eyebrow (and more) if a gentleman said, &ldquo;Whassup Miss Bennet? It&rsquo;s good to see ya!&rdquo; It&rsquo;d take you completely out of your &ldquo;suspend your disbelief&rdquo; state. My example was a bit obvious, but let me give you a more nuanced example. In a book I read recently, the author had 20-year-olds reference <em>Lolita</em> and use &ldquo;whom&rdquo; correctly in colloquial dialogue. <em>That</em> punctured my &ldquo;suspend my disbelief&rdquo; state.</p>

<p>Of course, different readers have different degrees of suspension of his disbelief. That&rsquo;ll happen and frankly, it isn&rsquo;t the author&rsquo;s problem. It&rsquo;s the reader&rsquo;s problem.</p>

<p>A work must be <em>accurate</em> enough to create a believable world that allows readers to suspend their disbelief. Now, this means that the author must do his or her due diligence in researching, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the author must <em>live</em> the world to tell a good story. If an author gets the material of 1600s underwear wrong, it&rsquo;s okay as long as readers believe the story.</p>

<p>Of course, one important caveat applies here: <em>context</em>. If the author intends for the work to be a fantastical piece of work that defies credibility, we can hardly demand accuracy (authenticity here is a different issue). If the author wants to write a story where people wear petticoats and text &ldquo;LOL&rdquo; to each other, that&rsquo;s his prerogative. We should only look for accuracy  in works that purport to tell from a non-fantastical point of view.</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s authenticity then?</p>

<h3>Authenticity&mdash;<em>not</em> accuracy&mdash;is about being true to our dreams and desires. (In other words, true to humanity.)</h3>

<p>As most will know from one of my answers, I think emotional authenticity is the most important authenticity of them all.[4]</p>

<p>I may have obfuscated the issue with my terminology. By emotional authenticity, I don&rsquo;t mean writers must only write about <em>accurate</em> emotions. That&rsquo;d be quite limiting. Due to societal constraints, most of us never act on our emotional responses. We have dreams and desires that we never act upon, which seems to be a part of the human condition.</p>

<p>Fictional characters can be allegories for our repressed hopes and dreams. Sometimes, they are the people we wish, with all of our hearts, that we could be. Other fictional characters are the people among us. These characters are so real that we can imagine them sitting next to us on the bus, walking down the grocery store aisles. Both have the ability, in the right hands, to make us love (or hate) them.</p>

<p>Some painters paint a near-exact likeness; other painters paint images where you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s up and what&rsquo;s down. What matters is whether the painting evokes an <em>emotional</em> response from the reader.The two paintings are beautiful in different ways, but are beautiful nevertheless.</p>

<h3>Case in point: Quentin Tarantino and &ldquo;wanting to be black.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The discussion about authenticity reminds me the controversy about Quentin Tarantino (director)&rsquo;s focus on black culture and issues in his films. Spike Lee says in a <em>Variety</em> interview,</p>

<blockquote><p>Quentin is infatuated with [the word &ldquo;nigger&rdquo;]. What does he want? To be made into a honorary black man?[5]</p></blockquote>

<p>What Spike Lee is implying here is that Tarantino, since his skin is quite a few shades paler than a black man&rsquo;s, shouldn&rsquo;t get too &ldquo;into&rdquo; black culture since it wouldn&rsquo;t be <em>authentic</em>. (What Lee means here is that Tarantino won&rsquo;t be <em>accurate</em> in showing the black experience.)</p>

<p>Tarantino responds with:</p>

<blockquote><p>As a writer, I demand the right to write any character in the world that I want to write. I demand the right to be them, I demand the right to think them and I demand the right to tell the truth as I see they are, all right? And to say that I can&rsquo;t do that because I&rsquo;m white, but the Hughes brothers can do that because they&rsquo;re black, that is racist.[5]</p></blockquote>

<p>Tarantino may seem a poor example of authenticity, since he directs and write revenge thrillers. In <em>Inglorious Basterds</em>, he revised history to have a Jewish scalping squad and to off Hitler. In <em>Django Unchained</em>, Tarantino, once again revises history to have the slaves rise up against their masters.</p>

<p>Tarantino isn&rsquo;t trying to be accurate since every history book contradicts him. He&rsquo;s not even trying to be true to &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; human actions. (Last time I checked, most people didn&rsquo;t gather samurai swords and hunt down their enemies.) But where Tarantino&rsquo;s storytelling genius lies&mdash;and this is as authentic as it gets&mdash;is his understanding of our <strong>desire for revenge</strong>.</p>

<p>Most of us will never tell the boss whom we hate (the ass keeps us late at work when he goes to meet his mistress). But as we sit in our gray cubicle, we dream about getting that damn sword and offing that megalomanic jerk. We want to be these people on the screen, putting it to the bad guys. We will probably never be that person, but Quentin understands that. Quentin has tapped into a truly <em>authentic</em> part of humanity: or repressed dreams of vengeance.</p>

<h3>Authenticity isn&rsquo;t about <em>accuracy</em>, it&rsquo;s about being true to the human condition. It&rsquo;s fiction, not nonfiction.</h3>
