<div class="entry-content"><p>No matter what our pretensions are, no writer can spin out a perfect story  by themselves. Feedback has the potential to push your work to the next level.</p>

<p>Great! But&hellip;<em>how</em> do you get feedback?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been at this long enough to know it isn&rsquo;t easy, but it&rsquo;s not impossible.  Here are a few things that I&rsquo;ve learned (and I still have some more to learn):</p>

<p><strong>Like cold-calling, cold-requesting rarely works.</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why cold-calling investors has a miserable success rate. It&rsquo;s somewhat creepy and nobody wants to be interrupted during dinnertime. People don&rsquo;t trust strangers and door-to-door salesmen.</p>

<p>You may get lucky, but the odds are against you.</p>

<p><strong>Form friendships with like-minded people.</strong></p>

<p>It was only when I started to befriend other writers when I started to get quality feedback. Their feedback is worth its weight in gold since they have a deep understanding of what it takes to write. Plus, I try to befriend cool people, so the feedback is just a fringe benefit.</p>

<p>A <em>big</em> caveat here: you need to be real friends with them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s human nature. People are far more willing to part with 100 dollars for a dear friend thant they are willing to part with five cents for a street beggar. We seem to have an instinctual willingness to help the ones close to us.</p>

<p><strong>Be generous with your thoughts and time.</strong></p>

<p>This is closely related to the previous point. It&rsquo;s hard to make friends if you&rsquo;re a selfish miser; just look at Ebenzener Scrooge in The <em>Christmas Carol</em>. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he couldn&rsquo;t find anyone to critique his storefront design.</p>

<p>Give people good, thoughtful feedback. Most people will return the favor. You don&rsquo;t even necessarily need to be generous with your feedback, but you do need to be generous with your time and kindness.</p>

<p>Most people&mdash;selfish misers excepted&mdash;have the natural tendency to want to return favors. Kindness has a way of coming back to you, one way or another.</p>

<p><strong>Realize that you will get about 20% yield on feedback.</strong></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect everyone, even your bestest friend in the whole wide world, to deliver on their feedback. It takes time and energy, something that people don&rsquo;t always have.</p>

<p>So, even in the bast-case scenario, you will have to prepare to do certain things by yourself. Hopefully you have enough good, smart friends to make up the difference.</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of the feedback&rsquo;s content, always be gracious.</strong></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll get lucky and someone gives you feedback&hellip;except that it&rsquo;s bad. Some of the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; feedback will point out flaws in your work. Other will just be bad.</p>

<p>No matter what they say, you always, <em>always</em>, say, &ldquo;Thank you. I will look into it.&rdquo; You can even ask questions and try to clarify their thinking, but do not attack them outright.They gave their time to you, and that is worth some politeness (even if the person isn&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>You just look way classier this way. Others will notice.</p>

<p><strong>Ask specific questions to get better feedback.</strong></p>

<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;ve finally gotten some people to give you feedback. You ask them, &ldquo;So, what did you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;I don&rsquo;t like the main character&rsquo;s name. It was fine otherwise&rdquo;</p>

<p>Giving feedback is a rare talent. Most people need to be guided. This will require some serious work on  your part and substantial self-awareness. You&rsquo;ll have to assess your project&rsquo;s potential weak spots. It&rsquo;s hard, but you can do it.</p>

<p>Try this instead:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you think about the conflicts between the protagonist and her father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was exciting, but too rushed. I felt like the fight was done with too quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>That</em> feedback you can really use.</p>

<p>Getting feedback is hard. Knowing what to do with it is harder.</p>

<p><em>Comments and suggestions welcome, particularly in regards to the ordering of this list. I&rsquo;m glad to discuss anything that I missed as well.</em></p>
