  <div class="story-content">
  <p>Faith Barnes hugged her backpack tighter as the bus bounced as it hit a pothole. Faith squeezed her eyes shut as the bus’ metal frame rattled all around her. She never liked buses. They were full of noise and strangers. Faith couldn’t even look out of the graffitied windows, since the moving landscape made her dizzy and queasy.</p>

<p>As the road smoothed out, Faith peeked past her backpack down the aisle at the almost-empty bus. A large man with a shaved head, skin folds creasing the back of his neck, met her gaze and smiled. Faith’s eyes darted down to her backpack and her cheeks flushed deep pink. She kept her eyes fixed on the worn edges of the backpack’s
logo.</p>

<p>Slowly, Faith unzipped the backpack, listening to the teeth clicking apart, and slid her hand into the opening. She sighed and smiled when she felt her books’ worn edges. The pages curled up at the sides, feeling soft and velvety under her fingers. The book’s spine was ridged with creases, broken so often that the book fell open to Faith’s favorite section whenever left out. Faith wondered which book she was touching. She hoped it was Jane Eyre, which would be perfect. Wuthering Heights left Faith too confused, unsure if she should adore or loathe Heathcliff. Pride and Prejudice’s Elizabeth Bennet was too vivacious for today. Anne Elliot may work, but Faith preferred Jane Eyre’s plainness over Anne Elliot’s faded beauty. It was Jane Eyre, Faith decided.</p>

<p>“Bus station!” shouted the bus driver as the bus screeched to a stop.
Faith scrambled out of her seat, arms aching from gripping her backpack so tightly. Ducking her head, she headed down the steps.</p>

<p>“Hey, you okay? Your parents going to meet you here?” asked the bus driver. Her voice was hoarse and gravelly, the voice of hundreds of cigarettes smoked and discarded. Faith turned around and peered up at the large woman whose forearms rippled with muscle as she gripped the door handle. Her graying black hair was pulled back tight as she smiled down at Faith.</p>

<p>After a quick inhale, Faith nodded. “Yes, ma’am. I’m okay,” she whispered, her voice barely above the engine’s rumble. As soon as she said the last word,  she leapt off the last step and ran to the street corner.</p>

<p>Everyone thought Faith Barnes was younger than she was. Her slight body, usually swaddled in baggy jeans and sweatshirts, made her look like she was thirteen instead of sixteen. Her squeaky, high-pitched voice only confirmed her prepubescence. Faith usually didn’t mind, but it would make all of this much harder when people kept asking questions. Please, let this work, she prayed, don’t let anyone notice me.</p>

<p>As Faith stood at the street corner, waiting for the light to change, she smoothed her hand over her backpack, making sure the zipper was fully closed. Everything she needed was in there: clothes, money and books. Feeling the outlines of her books through the canvas made the tension in Faith’s shoulders ease a little.</p>

<p>The white pedestrian signal flashed and Faith started to cross. As she shuffled over the asphalt, Faith thought about how brave Jane Eyre was, standing up for her beliefs. The memory of reading the words, “I’ll never call you aunt again,” made Faith shiver. Faith’s thoughts drifted to Edward Rochester and how Jane had chosen love over a lonely missionary’s life in India.</p>

<p>An engine started with a loud bang a few feet away, but Faith kept her head down, still thinking of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester. She could almost feel the foggy and damp cold of the English countryside on her skin. The thought of the sprawling countryside made her giggle under her breath. At home, she had spent hours staring at the pictures of the English manors with their manicured gardens and shrubs, wondering what it would feel like to feel the grass under her feet, whether it would be different than the grass here. Faith knew the grass would feel cleaner, neater and more perfect.</p>

<p>A shout rose up nearby, making Faith look up. Faith didn’t have time to turn around fully before she heard an engine’s whine right by her ear. A whine that was only inches away.</p>

<p>A silver light flashed in her peripheral vision before Faith felt something slam into the back of her head. For a moment, Faith just felt a sudden, sharp pressure at her head as time stopped moving.</p>

<p>As if time had skipped ahead like a scratched record, faith found  herself on her knees by the curb, rancid black water streaming by her knees. Faith heard herself cry out, but it sounded distant and weak. As she watched a piece of paper with a footprint on it fly by, Faith wondered how she had gotten there,  Her head started to pound and the pain in her head and knees grew sharper as she breathed.</p>

<p>“Ow,” groaned Faith, almost too quiet for her to hear herself.</p>

<p>“Oh shit,” a deep voice said from behind her. “Oh shit. Uh—Hey. Hey! You! Little girl! You okay?” the voice called out.</p>

<p>As Faith felt the cold wetness sink through her jeans, she pushed herself to her feet. All of the aches in her body fused together into one painful throb. Tottering, Faith turned toward the voice.</p>

<p>A bearded, ruddy-cheeked man in his thirties sat in the truck, his red-rimmed eyes blinking slowly. Faith stood there, returning his stare.</p>

<p>“You okay? I can’t—I can’t lose my license. I—oh shit. My wife. Work—oh shit. I can’t—”</p>

<p>The man’s voice sounded far away and muffled. Faith heard the words, but they meant nothing to her.</p>

<p>“Oh shit. You’re bleeding, little girl,” the man said. He turned to face his windshield. “I can’t lose my license.”</p>

<p>The man twisted the keys in the ignition and the sharp smell of gasoline rose into the air as the truck drove off, leaving behind a puff of exhaust. Faith stared at the truck’s rear bumper, wondering what the man had been talking about.</p>

<p>“Wait!” a woman shouted from across the street. “Don’t move! You’re bleeding!”</p>

<p>This time, Faith was certain the woman was talking to her. She pressed a few gentle fingers to the back of her head, which felt hot and ached in time with her heartbeat. Warm stickiness covered her fingers and sharp pain dug into her skull as her fingers moved deeper.</p>

<p>“Ow,” muttered Faith.</p>

<p>Lifting her hands to her face, Faith gasped. Bright crimson covered her shaking fingers. Dizziness overtook her and Faith started to stumble backwards, her arms flailing.</p>

<p>A squat woman, with gray streaks in her tangled brown hair, slid her warm hand around Faith’s elbow, stopping Faith’s backwards sprint. It took Faith more than a moment of looking down at the woman’s anxious face to remember the voice telling her not to move.
“Are you all right?” the woman said, her alto voice edged with a faint unidentifiable accent. “That man just drove off. What a brute! I didn’t see the license plate number or I’d report him.”</p>

<p>Faith slid her backpack from her shoulders into her arms, its weight a relief. The backpack reminded her of something, but the memory floated just out of reach.</p>

<p>The woman peered up. “What’s your name?” she asked, her hand still warm on Faith’s elbow.</p>

<p>Faith stared down at the small woman, her mind grasping for answers, but coming up with blankness. Jane! Faith finally thought, but she knew that wasn’t right. The void where her name was supposed to be made Faith’s head ache even more. Faith slipped out of the woman’s grasp.</p>

<p>“Go away,” Faith whispered, pressing the lumpy backpack to her chest. “Please, go away.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name, honey? I’m Elena. Don’t be scared.” The woman’s callused hands reached out for her. “You’re hurt, you need help.”</p>

<p>Faith shook her head, wincing when she felt a few new trickles of blood run down her neck. The pain had faded to a dull but insistent ache. Her airway started to constrict making her wheeze. “Just go away. I’m okay,” she whispered over and over again.</p>

<p>A burly man in a heavy plaid jacket stopped in front of Faith. “You need help?” he asked, walking toward Faith slowly as if she was a skittish wild animal. When Faith didn’t respond, he looked down at Elena. “What happened to her?”</p>

<p>“A truck hit her. I think she’s in shock,” Elena said, keeping her black eyes on Faith. “She won’t tell me her name. I don’t think her parents are here.”</p>

<p>Men and women walked past her, craning their necks to stare at her. Tears burned at the back of Faith’s sinuses as she felt more eyes fixing upon her. Faith inched her backpack up her body, covering her mouth.</p>

<p>“Ple-Please, go away,” Faith sputtered, her tears making her words watery and weak.</p>

<p>The man glanced at her and extended his hand. “C’mon kid. What’s your name? Where are your parents?”</p>

<p>Her alarm ratcheted up even more at the mention of her parents. Faith’s breath came so fast and shallow that the sidewalk started to lurch under her feet. “No! Go away!” she started to whisper over andover again.</p>

<p>“She’s going nuts,” the man muttered. “I’m going to call the cops.” The man started to whisper into a small black cellphone.</p>

<p>As Elena reached for the backpack, Faith’s voice rose to a shriek. “No! Don’t touch it!”</p>

<p>Startled, Elena and the man took a step back. The shriek had stolen all of Faith’s available oxygen and she started to pant. The distant sirens grew louder as Faith squeezed her eyes shut and nestled in a corner, surrounded by discarded candy wrappers and the smell of diesel fumes. The next few minutes faded into blackness as people wearing EMT and police uniforms surrounded her.</p>

<hr />

<p>Faith  felt herself slowly rising into consciousness, but her eyelids felt too heavy to lift. She simply settled into the self-imposed darkness as she roused.</p>

<p>“Will she be all right? All these stitches…” a tinny female voice said. “When will we be able to take her home?”</p>

<p>The voice almost sounded familiar, but Faith’s leaden limbs forbade her from moving.. Faith just lay there, listening.</p>

<p>“You can take her home now, ma’am,” a tired female voice responded. “The stitches look good and there doesn’t seem to be any permanent damage. There may be some memory loss due to the injury, but hopefully it’ll be temporary.”</p>

<p>“Memory loss? What if she doesn’t remember me? I couldn’t…”</p>

<p>“No, Mary. She’ll be fine. The doctors here know what they’re talking about,” a low, gruff voice said. “Don’t pester her with trivial questions when she has other patients to attend to.”</p>

<p>“But—” the reedy voice said, then sighed. “Okay, Jake. Have it your way.”</p>

<p>After a flurry of conversation, the doctor’s voice was gone and the male voice was talking again. The deep voice reminded Faith of dark rooms and shouting, making Faith’s eyes fly open The gruff-voiced man was stocky with gray spreading from his sideburns towards his crown. Deep lines ran between his eyes and around his mouth. The man’s face was familiar and unfamiliar all at once. Nobody looked at Faith as she lay there, her knuckles as white as the sheets underneath.</p>

<p>“What in the hell happened, Mary? How did she manage to sneak out?” the man barked, his voice filling the room.</p>

<p>“Jake, I was at work…”</p>

<p>“You didn’t check in on her. Unbelievable. She could’ve been killed—”</p>

<p>Faith gasped at the formless memories of pans clanging and wet cheeks that the voices evoked. A man that Faith hadn’t noticed cleared his throat. The noise in the room stopped as if someone had pressed a mute button.</p>

<p>“She’s awake,” the man said in a quiet, steady voice. Everyone looked at the man, who wore a black uniform, a hat tucked under his right arm.</p>

<p>“Oh Faith! Oh, honey!” the woman said as she ran towards Faith. The woman wrapped trembling arms around Faith, her hot tears wetting Faith’s cheek. “You’re safe now. We’ll get you home soon. I’ll tuck you in just like the old times. I’ll make your favorite lasagna.”</p>

<p>Faith shrank from the woman’s overwhelming warmth, sinking as deeply into her pillow as she could.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember me?” the woman said, her voice quavering.</p>

<p>Faith stared at the woman’s pale and drawn face, but only terrifying cloudiness filled her mind. “No, I—I don’t, I don’t…” Faith stammered.
“I’m your mother. You must remember me. You must.” The woman grasped Faith’s hand, pressing it to her chest. “I’m your mother! I carried you! I sang to you! I stayed home when you were sick!” Her voice inched higher with every word.</p>

<p>The man gripped the woman’s shoulder. “Mary, don’t scare her.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t remember me. My own child…”</p>

<p>The man whispered, his voice suddenly soft. “It’s all right, Mary. It’s just temporary.”</p>

<p>Mary slipped free of his hand, her fingers pulling at her rusted silver necklace. “No, no…nobody remembers me…”</p>

<p>“Mary…” the man said and when Mary looked away, he stared at the ceiling. “Maybe Faith’s the lucky one.”</p>

<p>Faith had been slowly sliding down the bed, inching the sheet over herself. As the soft cotton covered her eyes, Faith wished that unconsciousness would return and sweep her away from this awful room.<br/>
The man in the corner cleared his throat again. “I’m sorry, Mister and Mrs. Barnes. I need to talk to Faith about the accident.”</p>

<p>The man nodded. “Of course, Officer. We’ll go get some coffee.”</p>

<p>“But shouldn’t we stay?” Mary whispered. “I could&hellip;”</p>

<p>“Officer Gilbert needs to do his job. He can’t do it with you interfering. Let’s go,” the man said, already at the door.</p>

<p>Mary stood by the bed, her fingers twiddling her silver chain. “Once we get you home, you’ll be safe with me, okay? I love you.”</p>

<p>Faith let the sheet slide off her face as they disappeared. The words her and parents wouldn’t—couldn’t—belong in the same sentence.</p>

<p>“Hi Faith, I’m Officer Gilbert,” the man in the police uniform said, interrupting Faith’s frantic thoughts. Officer Gilbert extended his hand. Faith shook it, trembling. Standing next to the bed, the dark and tall stranger loomed over Faith, forbidding and powerful.</p>

<p>“Am I under arrest?” Faith whispered.</p>

<p>Officer Gilbert chuckled, the friendly noise puncturing Faith’s dread. “No, we don’t usually arrest victims. I’m here to help you and catch the guy who did this to you.”</p>

<p>“Help me,” Faith breathed. The phrase sounded lyrical and perfect on her tongue. She wish she could say it over and over again.</p>

<p>“Yeah, so I’ll ask you some questions about the accident, okay?”</p>

<p>Hiding a smile behind her hand, Faith nodded. As Officer Gilbert scribbled notes, Faith tried to remember the accident. Whenever she remembered a detail—the truck’s color, the driver’s age and the first letter of the license plate—Officer Gilbert smiled. It was a magnificent smile, transforming his face from ordinariness into handsomeness. Faith tried to sharpen the vague memories of the street outside the crumbling bus station so she could glimpse Officer Gilbert’s smile once more.</p>

<p>Once they had wrung all of the details out of Faith’s amorphous memories, Officer Gilbert settled back in his chair, his pad propped up on his lap. “Now, let’s talk about why you were at the bus station in the first place,” he said.</p>

<p>“What?” Faith squeaked.</p>

<p>Officer Gilbert sighed and retrieved papers from his pocket.  “Right here are some tickets for you to go to London, but your parents knew nothing about it. Why were you going to London?”</p>

<p>The papers seemed to grow bigger, their whiteness threatening to consume Faith. As she stared at the words, London Heathrow, Faith started to wheeze. Choking out the words, Faith said, “No. I—I don’t know. I don’t…I don’t remember.” Then Faith sat up straight “Where’s my backpack? Give it to me!” she shrieked.</p>

<p>Officer Gilbert jumped at the high-pitched cry. He wheeled about, only finding the backpack tucked under the bed after several minutes of frantic searching. When the backpack’s weight finally settled onto her lap, Faith gathered it into her arms and buried her face into the rough canvas.</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Faith?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“I am now,” Faith breathed.</p>

<p>Officer Gilbert stood there, watching Faith rock back and forth, huddled over the stained backpack. The chair screeched as Officer Gilbert brought it closer to the bed.</p>

<p>“Do your parents hit you?” Officer Gilbert asked, his voice low and calm.</p>

<p>Faith rocked faster. “These people who were just here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Faith thought about their faces: the muscle that always twitched on the man’s jaw; the bluish and swollen shadows under the woman’s eyes that only deepened as the day went on. Faith now knew that these faces were the same faces that she had seen her entire life.  Rocking even faster, Faith tried to banish the memories of her mother’s lilting voice singing lullabies. These people were her parents, Faith could no longer deny it.</p>

<p>“If they hit you, I can help,” Officer Gilbert whispered. “I’ll call the CPS and file a report. You won’t have to see them again.”</p>

<p>Faith’s eyes fluttered open, focusing anew on Officer Gilbert. In his black uniform, he looked impossibly tall and dark against the stark white hospital walls.  For one flashing moment, Faith imagined Officer Gilbert atop of a horse in front of a grand English manor, his black cape unfurling in the wind.</p>

<p>Faith opened her mouth to say yes, but she couldn’t.</p>

<p>The memories still felt distant and blurry, but they held no punches or blood. Faith wished that there was just a little blood so she could say yes, but she couldn’t lie, not to him.</p>

<p>“No. They never hit me,” Faith whispered from behind the backpack.</p>

<p>Officer Gilbert sighed and sat back. “Then why did you run away?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>Except for her mother’s sweet voice singing lullabies and the noise of pans crashing, everything before the accident was shrouded in heavy mist. Faith could see the hazy outlines of her past, but nothing more.</p>

<p>Officer Gilbert gave up on riddling out the mystery of Faith Barnes after half a hour of asking questions with no answers. “All right. I guess it’s time for you to go home. I’ll go get your parents” Officer Gilbert said.</p>

<p>Faith’s hand flew out and grabbed Officer Gilbert’s arm. “No! Wait. I…” she squeaked. “Don’t take me to them. I don’t want to go home. Please.”</p>

<p>“Were you telling me the truth about them not hitting you?” He paused. “Does your father touch…”</p>

<p>Faith shook hear head so hard that she felt her stitches pulling at her skin. “No! No…”</p>

<p>Officer Gilbert remained quiet, then pried Faith’s fingers from his arm to reach into his pocket. Out came a small white card. “You can call this number if your parents ever hurt you, or anyone else hurts you.”</p>

<p>“You’ll help me?” Faith whispered, cradling the card in her palm.</p>

<p>The black words, Upper Darby Police Station, were emblazoned on the heavy white paper. Underneath the words was a scrawled name, Ben Gilbert, and a phone number. Faith held onto the card, afraid that it would fly away.</p>

<p>Officer Gilbert paused, then sighed. “If someone broke the law, I can help. But otherwise…I can’t help.”</p>

<p>Faith nodded absent-mindedly,  the words indistinct as Faith tucked the card into a special pocket in her backpack. She promised herself that she would never lose that card, always keeping it safe forever and ever. The words, I can’t help, vanished from Faith’s memories, unheard and unwanted.</p>

<p>As Officer Gilbert nodded his goodbye, he put on his hat, turning into a dark silhouette in Faith’s dazed eyes. As he disappeared, Faith imagined the tall and dark figure sweeping down the hospital corridors, then fading into the darkness outside. Closing her eyes, Faith could see Officer Gilbert on a horse, galloping across the countryside to save someone, someone like Faith. Maybe he’ll come back, Faith thought. The image of Officer Gilbert swooping in and lifting her onto his horse made Faith giggle against her backpack.</p>

<hr />

<p>Faith closed her eyes as the car drove towards what her parents called home. The only noise in the car was the engine’s rumble and the occasional huff from Mary Barnes. They parked outside of a house that looked like every other houses on the street: a small two-bedroom house with a porch and two square windows. This house was painted in an unmemorable shade of taupe, making it fade into the row of neat prefab houses that lined the street. Faith stared at the house’s plain face, feeling its familiarity creep up on her. Suddenly, Faith remembered walking out of the house that morning, getting on the bus and praying that they wouldn’t notice her disappearance before she was soaring over the Atlantic.</p>

<p>“It’s time for us to discuss this,” the father said. “Go inside Faith.”</p>

<p>Arms trembling around her backpack, Faith entered the house and sat at the dining table. Faint memories of how the wooden chairs hurt her back and a voice saying, “Faith, sit up straight,” echoed in Faith’s mind as she felt the hard wood at her back.</p>

<p>“Well?” Jake Barnes said from across the table.</p>

<p>“Jake. She needs food and some sleep, not this,” Mary said as she sat next to Faith.</p>

<p>Faith’s father put his hands flat on the table. “No, Mary. This isn’t being fifteen minutes late for curfew. She tried to run away to London for Christ’s sake. I don’t even know how she thought she’d make it through customs. It’s time for Faith to answer for what she did.”</p>

<p>Faith began to shiver even though the heat was on full blast.</p>

<p>“We all make mistakes. Let her sleep, at least. She’s exhausted.”</p>

<p>“No, Mary. I’ve let you do this for too long. I thought it was best after—”</p>

<p>“Faith is the only thing we have, Jake!”</p>

<p>Faith pushed her face deeper into her backpack as a memory barged into her consciousness. The memory of her chubby six-year-old hand reaching for a doorknob that wouldn’t move and hearing her mother’s gasping sobs behind the door floated to the surface. So did the memories of how her mother came home, her skin bluish-gray, and how everyone had to wear black for weeks afterwards. Faith began to wheeze.</p>

<p>“I know, Mary. Goddamn it, stop thinking about what we can’t have and think about what we have. Let Faith grow up”</p>

<p>“She’s just sixteen. She’s just a baby.”</p>

<p>“Damn it, Mary. You were seventeen when you had her. Sixteen isn’t a baby anymore. It’s time for her to get her nose out of books and look around.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be cruel. Let her dream a little.”</p>

<p>“Please stop it,” Faith whispered, her words swallowed up by her backpack.</p>

<p>“I’m not being cruel, Mary. I’m being realistic.”</p>

<p>Faith clasped her fists to her ears, but the voices kept on drowning out her thoughts. Her wheezing grew into stifled gasps that sounded like a screeching mixture of chokes and shrieks.</p>

<p>“I’m a good mother! I lover her!”</p>

<p>Faith squeezed her eyes as tightly as she could, trying to lose herself in the darkness, then she remembered everything.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday, Faith lay in bed as she always did, cuddled up with a book that smelled like what books should smell like: woodsy and musty. Voices drifted upstairs from the kitchen, punctuated by the sound of cabinets slamming. Faith tried to focus on the words in front of her, but the voices filled her head.</p>

<p>“Did you see Faith’s report card? Four C’s and one B. If she doesn’t do better, she can’t get into a good college.”</p>

<p>“Jake, leave it alone. She’s fine.”</p>

<p>“No, she’s not, goddamn it. I know what these girls at school are doing to her. You let her stay at home like a coward.”</p>

<p>“She comes back home crying. What am I supposed to do?”</p>

<p>“Help her stand up for herself. We won’t be around forever. She has to grow up.”</p>

<p>“Why? She’s fine just as she is.”</p>

<p>“She’s not fine. She’s too much like—”</p>

<p>“Like me, Jake? I didn’t ask for this to happen to me. It’s not my fault!”</p>

<p>“Goddamn it, Mary. Stop saying this shit. These kids were mine too, but you don’t see me popping pills, do you?”</p>

<p>A gasping sob rose up from the kitchen. “You don’t understand. You never have.”</p>

<p>The cry was followed by the sound of feet running up the stairs and a door slamming. As she usually did, Faith covered her ears, trying to stop the noises. Despite her hands pressing against her ears, she still heard her father muttering.</p>

<p>“Jesus, I’m going to leave this nuthouse only if…”</p>

<p><em>Leave, leave, leave</em>, the word repeated itself in her mind. If her father left, Faith would be all alone here. Faith could already feel the grief and sadness next door draining all oxygen from the air. If her father left, then Faith would suffocate, losing herself to someone else’s torment. She started to tremble, but then the thought returned, leave. Maybe I should  leave too, go somewhere far away, somewhere without shouts and muffled cries, Faith thought. England! The answer to her unasked questions was perfect in its simplicity.</p>

<p>The hazy nights of the English shore would engulf her, making her disappear into the shadows. As another door slammed downstairs, the thoughts of lights burning dimly in the fog only grew clearer. Faith could see the lamp’s luminescence surrounding the lamppost. She could also see her own silhouette standing on the wet cobblestone streets. The picture looked perfect and true.</p>

<p>The next day, Faith had it all planned out. After school, Faith went to the bank and withdrew every cent of her six thousand dollars she had saved from odd jobs and bought bus and plane tickets. When her parents were sleeping, Faith snuck into the safe in her parents’ room and retrieved her passport. It thrilled her to think that a stamp would finally grace these empty blue pages. She set out on a Saturday, when she knew her father was on his shift at the firehouse and her mother was working at the store.</p>

<p>“Loving her doesn’t do a damn thing if you smother her.”</p>

<p>“Please stop it,” Faith mumbled into her backpack.</p>

<p>“I won’t let you become my father!” Mary hissed.</p>

<p>Faith swallowed, stopping her hyperventilating. “Stop it,” she croaked, her voice a bit stronger. When the din continued, Faith forced her voice louder. “Stop it!” she shouted, her sharp voice cutting through the noise.</p>

<p>Faith’s mother grasped at Faith’s shoulders. “What’s wrong, sweetie? Does your head hurt? Why don’t you go get some sleep and we’ll—”</p>

<p>“No!” Faith felt the books against her chest as she pressed the backpack harder to herself. “I left—I left because…” Faith inhaled, pushing her words past her numb tongue. “I left because I hate hearing you fight. I hate living here.”</p>

<p>“Fights?” Mary said in a high-pitched, cheerful tone. “No, we weren’t fighting! We were just talking.”</p>

<p>“I’m not stupid, Mom. I know about the pills too.”</p>

<p>Mary’s hand trembled at her neck. “No, I—No, that’s not…”</p>

<p>“Mary—”</p>

<p>“Stop it, Mom. I know. I know, okay?” Faith hissed, her jaw sore from its clenching. “I hate it. I’m sick of it.”</p>

<p>Mary’s hand moved up to her mouth as her eyes stared past Faith’s head. “Oh my god,” Mary whispered.</p>

<p>Faith closed her eyes, blotting out the sight of her mother’s tears.</p>

<p>“Faith, this isn’t an excuse,” Jack said in his deep voice, his fists on the table. “You still can’t sneak away and put yourself in danger.”</p>

<p>Faith kept her eyes on the scratches on table’s varnished surface as she spoke. “I heard you too, Dad. You said you were going to leave. I can’t be here alone. I can’t…”</p>

<p>All color left Jake’s cheeks. “You weren’t supposed to hear that.”</p>

<p>“I heard,” Faith whispered.</p>

<p>“Jesus, I was just angry,” muttered Jake into his hands as he put his face into his hands. “I wouldn’t…”</p>

<p>For the first time in Faith’s life, she saw her father slouch, his back curving over the table.  His face sagged, deepening the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth, belying his thirty-six years. He looked away from Faith, closing his eyes.</p>

<p>Silence settled between the three of them. Faith closed her eyes, trying not to think about cobblestone streets and giant manors.</p>

<p>“You’re grounded,” Jack finally said.</p>

<p>Faith’s head lurched upwards. “But…”</p>

<p>“You ran away. You put yourself in danger. You caused a lot of trouble for people, not to mention thousands of dollars in public service and hospital costs. You’re grounded for two months.”</p>

<p>Mary made a small choking noise, but kept her fist at her mouth. When Jake met her gaze, Mary just nodded and looked down.</p>

<p>Faith slumped in her chair and whispered, “Okay, but what about…”</p>

<p>“Your mother and I will discuss things.”</p>

<p>“But…” Faith forced herself to finish the sentence. “Will you leave?”</p>

<p>Jake’s eyelids drooped for a moment before he straightened and met Faith’s eyes. “No, I won’t,” he finally said.</p>

<p>“What if…what if…” Faith cut her eyes to her mother. “What if you get divorced?”</p>

<p>Mary started to cry, but Faith just looked at her father, whose face was white and stiff. “I don’t break promises, Faith. You know that.”</p>

<p>Rubbing her cheek against her backpack’s rough canvas, Faith closed her eyes. “I’d be okay with that, Dad. I give you my permission,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Mary continued sobbing beside Faith. “Both of you just want to leave me.”</p>

<p>Faith shuddered at these words, but forced herself to speak. “No, Mom. I won’t leave you. I just…I just want the fighting to stop.” She lifted her eyes to her father. “Please, Dad?”</p>

<p>“We’ll discuss it,” he said curtly.</p>

<p>Faith nodded and slid off the seat. With heavy feet, she trudged up the stairs and closed the door behind her. Her room looked just like it had this morning with the rumpled sheets, precarious towers of books and clothes covering the floor.  Faith smiled a little at the familiar sight.</p>

<p>Faith shoved a pile of clothes off her worn armchair and collapsed onto the creaky cushions, her backpack still snug against her chest. Her ears strained, waiting for the sound of shouts and doors slamming, but heard nothing more than murmurs that she couldn’t understand. Faith waited some more before the weariness of the day overtook her, her chin falling to her chest as she fell asleep.</p>

<p>A few hours later, the backpack fell onto the ground, starling Faith. Her fingers digging into the nubs in the chair’s fabric, Faith listened for her parents’ voices. The only noise in the entire house was the wind whistling outside.</p>

<p>Faith tried not to let panic overtake her. The thought that she had ruined everything looped in her mind on infinite repeat. She imagined her father’s suitcase packed and never seeing him again. She would be all alone as she heard the lock clicking as her mother locked herself into the bathroom. It would all be her fault. Smothering a cry, Faith shoved her hand into the backpack and it emerged with Officer Gilbert’s card.</p>

<p>The card reminded her of how the corners of Officer Gilbert’s eyes had crinkled and how his mouth had lifted up in a smile when she answered a question correctly. The tightness in her chest loosened and she could finally breathe again. Faith wanted to call him, just once, His smooth baritone would make all the bad memories and thoughts recede like the low tide. Perhaps he would sweep her into his car, thought Faith, and drive into the horizon. She would be safe there.</p>

<p>The card slid out of her fingers and glided onto the floor. Faith stared at the white rectangle on the dark carpet. The card seemed perfect there, its white unspoiled by smudges. Faith didn’t want to touch it and ruin its perfection, but she had to pick it up.</p>

<p>When she bent over, the words came back to her: if nobody broke the law, I can’t help you. Her hand stopped midair, hovering over the card. It seemed so easy to pick up that card and call the tall and dark stranger. Faith’s mind insisted that if she called, everything would be all right, but it wouldn’t be. The tall and dark stranger wouldn’t come galloping up to the house, ready to pull her onto the horse’s back. The tall and dark stranger was somewhere else, saving someone who needed saving more than she did. Nobody would come for her.</p>

<p>Holding her breath, Faith scooped up the card and walked to the window. Hesitating for several minutes, she finally opened the window and slid the card outside. Immediately, the wind swept the card away. The white card flittered in the air before disappearing into the darkness. Faith tried not to cry, she really did.</p>

<p>After staring into the pitch blackness, Faith tiptoed to her parents’ room. Opening the door a crack, she saw her mother huddled in the bed, fast asleep. Her father was in a chair in the corner of the room. His eyes met hers.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Faith,” he said. “We’ll figure it out together. Go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Faith blinked tears before nodding and closing the door. As she slipped between her sheets, she hoped that her father’s words were true. With that hope, Faith fell asleep.</p>

<p>Maybe Faith Barnes was her own savior.</p>
