  <div class="story-content">
  <p>Anita stood on the cracked sidewalk, her black hair whipping into her face. She watched the third-floor window of the red rowhouse. Maybe she would catch a glimpse of Bill today. The window remained empty, the white curtains unfurling in the wind. A gust of cold air cut through the warm breeze, a warning of winter’s coming.</p>

<p>Anita let the people dressed In the blacks, browns and taupes of professionalism stream past her. Her neck hurt from straining to see if Bill was all right. Once she had seen him, she could go home, a twenty-minute bus ride away sitting next to a homeless man who used the two-dollar bus ride as a day’s warmth.</p>

<p>Just a year ago, Anita had stood inside these windows, smoothing her tablecloths and putting away glasses. Her Matisse prints had hung from the walls, entirely too delicate and artsy for Bill’s heavy black leather couches. Now Anita wished that she hadn’t tried to make Bill exchange the overstuffed dead animal skins for something more elegant. Maybe it would have helped just a little.</p>

<hr />

<p>It had started a year ago with a few red spots on Bill’s skin. Fifteen minutes after he walked through the doorway, bumps started to spread from his chest down his arms and legs. “Probably just something I ate, I tried this vegetarian cheesesteak today, what an oxymoron,” Bill said, stuffing some chips into his mouth.</p>

<p>Anita ran her fingers down Bill’s chest, feeling the small protrusions. “Maybe you need someone to take care of you,” she murmured.</p>

<p>Bill stopped chewing and then smiled. “Maybe I do. Can I get a sponge bath?”</p>

<p>Anita tilted her head up, smoothing Bill’s collar. “Only if you say the right words.” He did.</p>

<hr />

<p>Over the next week, the bumps faded. Bill blamed it on the vegan cheesesteak. The memories of the angry red spots disappeared from both of their memories, a lesson learned—don’t eat oxymoronic sandwiches.</p>

<p>One morning, the bumps reappeared, redder and bigger than before. Each one rose so high that Anita felt like she was touching a soccer ball. A large red spot lay the middle of every bump. They spread so far high that the redness peeked past Bill’s collar, which was buttoned to the top.</p>

<p>“Bill, look at you. I’m calling the doctor’s office,” Anita said, phone in hand.</p>

<p>“No. It’s probably that damned cheesesteak still in my system. I have to work it out.”</p>

<p>“Bill, don’t be stupid. You ate the thing a week ago.”</p>

<p>Bill flung open the door to medicine cabinet. Mascara tubes, lotion bottles and deodorant cans tumble out, spilling out on the bathroom sink, casualties of some unknown war. “Goddamn it, where’s your powder thing? I need to cover up this. I can’t go into work like this. Mark’ll think I have fucking AIDS or something.”</p>

<p>The bright mirror lights made Bill’s bumps look even redder and angrier. “This is exactly why you should go to the doctor. Just call in sick,” Anita said, crossing her arms.</p>

<p>Bill leaned over the bathroom sink, chuckling. “It’s not that easy, Anita. A management spot is opening in a few months. If I take a single day off right now, I’ll look lazy. Fucking Oscar will jump on this.”</p>

<p>“But—”</p>

<p>“Jesus Christ, Anita. We need this promotion so you can quit that shitty paralegal job, okay?”
Anita stared at Bill’s now-pale face in the mirror.“That’s not fair, Bill,” Anita said, her voice inching higher.</p>

<p>Bill eyes drifted away from the mirror and his shoulders sagged. “I’m sorry. I’m just—well, the hell if I know. I just don’t want to go out like this. Please, Anita. Just let me go to work in peace.” Bill’s eyes rose to meet hers.</p>

<p>Anita shoved past Bill and reached into the medicine cabinet. Tossing a small plastic compact into the sink, Anita said, “It won’t match. I’m darker than you are, but it’ll neutralize the redness a little.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Anita sat at the foot of the bed, watching Bill. His eyes were closed. Stray hairs dotted his chin. Bumps still spread over his chest, arms and torso as if there was some phantom things inside of Bill’s skin, trying to get out. The only thing Anita could be grateful for was that the redness had faded into invisibility.</p>

<p>Anita reached out and touched Bill’s arm. He winced. “Please don’t. Your hand’s too hot.”</p>

<p>She moved her hand away, putting both of them into her lap. Holding herself still, Anita told herself not to touch Bill as he lay in bed, twitching.</p>

<p>Bill managed to get an appointment with a doctor on a Saturday morning, but now he dabbed Anita’s powder on the rash every morning before work. Bill came back from the doctor’s office, his lanky hair hanging in his face. “She wasn’t sure. Said that it was hives. She told me to go see an allergist. It’ll take three months for me to get an appointment.”</p>

<p>“So what do we do until then?” Anita asked.</p>

<p>“Dunno. They’re not sure if it’s allergies or not and it’s not that severe. So, nothing, I guess.”</p>

<p>Anita sat in the dark room, the laptop’s blue-white light making her skin ghostly. She scrolled through dozens, if not hundreds, of websites extolling the benefits of antioxidants, juice fasts, gluten-free diets and acupuncture. Anita watched documentaries discussing the health benefits of veganism.</p>

<p>“Bill, come here! I think I found something,” Anita said, her eyes still fixed on the glowing screen.</p>

<p>“What?” groaned Bill from the couch. He kept the lights off so he wouldn’t get headaches.</p>

<p>“I found an acupuncturist. He looks good.”</p>

<p>“Acupuncture? That sounds like voodoo science to me. I don’t like needles.”</p>

<p>“I hear they can do miracles. Change people’s body chemistry. It’s amazing.”</p>

<p>Bill sighed so deeply that it almost didn’t sound like it came from him. It sounded like it came from beneath Bill. “I don’t know, Cricket. I really hate needles.”
“They’re tiny needles. They won’t hurt, promise.”</p>

<p>Bill put his arm over his eyes and said in a muffled voice, “Okay, give me his address and number. I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>Bill went to Mr. Xue the following week. As he opened the door and letting in a icy gust of wind into the apartment, he shuddered. “You didn’t tell me that they were so long.” He rubbed his arm. “It was all right Mr. Xue said that I had too much fire. I don’t even know what that means. I’m not complaining too much though since the hives are going down.”</p>

<p>For a few days, Bill was back to his smooth, pasty self. Then the hives crept back a week later, redder and larger than ever.</p>

<p>Nuts, gluten, soy, pesticides and dairy became personas non grata in their kitchen. Anita stood in front of the fridge, wishing for some cheese sticks encrusted with almonds. Or some pizza with pine nuts, tomatoes and basil. Anita squeezed the rough plastic handle of the fridge and wished that she could just pick up the phone and order pizza like they used to.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when Bill wasn’t around, Anita would walk twelve blocks to the best pizza place in the city and order a few slices of its famous cheese pizza. Anita would close her eyes as she ate, letting the grease drip down to her chin. The two tears running down the cheek made the pizza taste too salty.
They had gone on their first date there.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Marf.” Anita woke to the muffled, strangled sound. In the dark bedroom. She could only see the vague outline of Bill’s head. “A—Ani…”</p>

<p>A shadow flailed near Anita’s hip, grasping at the air. “Bill! What’s happening?” Anita reached out to the shadow. Once she touched something, it felt…wrong. She only felt puffy, swollen flesh. Breaths came from Bill in sputters and coughs.</p>

<p>“Bill! Talk to me!” Anita cried, shaking the large mass of flesh that didn’t feel like Bill.
Bill didn’t move. “Arm,” Bill rasped.</p>

<p>Anita flung off the sheets and flipped the light switch. Light flooded the room and Anita backed up into the corner.</p>

<p>Bill’s forehead and eyebrows were thrice their usual size. His eyelids were so puffy that his eyes were slits in rising dough. His fingers were overstuffed sausages about to burst open.</p>

<p>“Okay, okay. I need to call—no, no. It’d take too long. We need to go somewhere, yes,” Anita stammered, not sure who she was talking to. “Doctor, no. They’re not open now. Hospital. Yes, hospital.”</p>

<p>Anita thought that Bill’s rasping sounded encouraging, so she pulled on some sweatpants. She tried to dress Bill’s heavy body, but only managed to get one arm into his shirt. Through some miracle, she got the pants up the entire way, and had to be satisfied with that.</p>

<p>Stumbling down the spiral staircase with Bill leaning on her, Anita hoped there would be a cab at this hour. Bill mumbled something that sounded vaguely like “green peas hell.”</p>

<p>Anita despaired when she managed to get Bill to the curb.  The still and silent street was dotted only by motionless orange lights. The damp chill of the early autumn morning descended on her, chasing away any lingering warmth from the bed. Bill moaned and sagged, leaning harder on her. Anita almost collapsed under his weight, her flip-flops sliding out from under her. Anita prayed for someone, something to save her.</p>

<p>Two bright white lights appeared, blinding in the distance.  Anita laughed and felt like she had called Jesus on a direct line and he actually answered. She started to wave at the cab.</p>

<p>As the cab screeched to a stop, its rear tires hopping off the road. The dark-skinned man inside looked at Bill. “He okay?” the driver said in a heavy Haitian accent.</p>

<p>“No, not really,” Anita said.</p>

<p>“That’s rough. Sorry, lady.”</p>

<p>Anita tipped Bill into the cab, hoping he wouldn’t smash his face, but he just flopped onto the seat. “The nearest hospital, please.” Anita was proud of herself for keeping her voice halfway steady. She inhaled the cab’s stale air and held Bill in her arms.</p>

<p>The driver grunted and pressed the gas pedal. Anita almost hit the partition as the cab sped east toward the Pennsylvania Hospital. Going to the oldest hospital in the country almost made Anita feel better as she held Bill’s head on her lap.</p>

<p>Anita gave the cab driver a ten-dollar tip for an ten-dollar ride. The cab driver grinned a bright white grin, mumbling his thanks in French.</p>

<p>A blur of white and blue uniforms descended on Anita and Bill, shouting orders that Anita didn’t hear. All she heard was, “Ma’am, you need to let go now. He’s in anaphylactic shock.” Anita didn’t know which face it belonged to. When she looked down, Anita saw how her fingers were sinking into Bill’s flesh. With a deep breath, she released him to the barking voices, seeing the marks that her fingers had left on his shoulders.</p>

<p>A few hours later, Anita heard, “Ma’am, you can go in now to visit Mr. Daniels now.”</p>

<p>Bill still looked like a lump of raw dough sitting on his bed. His eyes, peering out from between slit, followed Anita. “Thanks, Cricket,” he croaked. “They said that you saved my life. Got me here just in time.”</p>

<p>“I almost didn’t. That cab—I should’ve called a cab.”</p>

<p>“We made it, that’s all that counts,” Bill said, pulling Anita’s hand toward him. Anita inched closer and thought, This is what Bill will look like when he’s seventy. Now that the swelling had gone down a little, Bill’s heavy lids and puffy forehead only looked like a face of an old man swollen from a long harsh life. Anita wasn’t sure if she liked the old man Bill.
“So, what did the doctors say?” Anita asked as she draped her arms around Bill. The heat of his skin almost made Anita recoil in surprise, but she forced herself to remain still.</p>

<p>“They say it was an anaphylactic shock. They’re sending my blood for some tests. They think it’s something like compound allergens. It’s insane. Nobody in my family has allergies. Nobody.”</p>

<p>“Are they doing anything for it? I mean, you couldn’t—”</p>

<p>“Yeah, they’re giving me steroids.”</p>

<p>“You can’t take these! I’ve read about their side effects. Your dad had diabetes.” Anita clasped her hands together. “I did lots of research. It causes high glucose levels. You won’t be able to sleep. I’ve read that juice fasts help. Maybe you can—”</p>

<p>“No, please, Anita. Not more of this. The new-age shit isn’t working. I gave up beer and pizza, but look at what happened. Enough is enough. The steroids are working.”</p>

<p>Amid the puffiness, Anita could see the slight bluish tinge under his eyes and the way that Bill blinked slowly at her. “Okay. We’ll wait for the test results,” she whispered as she laid her head next to Bill’s.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two weeks later, the test results came back negative for common allergies. Bill didn’t have a reaction to pollen or to peanuts, soy, gluten, oak, birch, pine or dust. The strongest reaction that Bill had was to cats, but he only registered a 0.07 on the test results. Anita and Bill didn’t have pets. So, Bill kept on taking two tablets of prednisone every day.</p>

<p>At first the nighttime twitches had been mild, more like tremors than convulsions. As Bill swallowed more pills every morning, the tremors grew into spasms. Bill’s entire body would go rigid and then his arms would fly out, pushing Anita off the bed.</p>

<p>“Stay still, for God’s sake!” Anita shrieked, jumping out of bed.</p>

<p>“What? I didn’t do anything!” Bill’s voice was groggy with sleep.</p>

<p>“You shoved me off the bed, you moron.” Anita grabbed the pillow. “I’m sleeping in the living room and rubbed the fresh bruise on her arm. After two months of the steroid regimen, bruises covered Anita’s arms.</p>

<p>“I was sleeping!”</p>

<p>“You still pushed me off!”</p>

<p>Anita gasped for air as she slammed the door behind her. She hadn’t had a decent night’s sleep in months. Despite Anita telling herself that the pushes and punches weren’t Bill’s fault, they hurt just the same. At this moment, Anita didn’t care whether Bill meant it or not. Pain hurt, regardless of explanations and excuses.</p>

<p>Even though the loveseat was too small for her, it was a flat surface that didn’t move every few moments. Anita threw the pillow onto the loveseat and curled up. As her breathing slowed, Anita half-hoped that Bill would come and say goodnight.</p>

<p>He didn’t. Anita fell asleep, almost immediately falling into unconsciousness.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nobody found the culprit of Bill’s hives, despite sending vials of Bill’s blood to dozens of labs all over Philadelphia. Anita had stopped reading the test results. They all said the same thing: statistically insignificant or no response to potential allergens.</p>

<p>Every day, Bill took three tablets of prednisone with his orange juice in the mornings. All of the side effects that Anita had read about crept up on Bill.</p>

<p>Pockets of fat collected around Bill’s collarbone and stomach. Bill replaced all of his 32-inch waist pants with 38-inch waists. Bill stopped shaving, letting his beard hide the slow spread of heavy jowls that made him look closer to fifty rather than twenty-nine.</p>

<p>In August, Bill finally got an appointment with Doctor Kimberley Brenner, the leading allergist researcher at University of Pennsylvania, because she had a last-minute cancellation. Bill and Anita sat in her office. The walls were bare except for  three small photographs of sailboats.</p>

<p>“I see that your reactions are marked as idiopathic,” Dr. Brenner said, leafing through the thick pile of papers. “They also did a large array of tests. Even sugar, but…” she frowned, “they didn’t test for the humanoid A-35 enzyme intolerance.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Bill asked. Anita stared at the photographs, wondering if it had been taken in Maine or North Carolina.</p>

<p>“It’s a discovery of mine.” Dr. Brenner’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “You see, a small percentage of the population secretes a particular type of enzyme. An even smaller percentage is highly intolerant to this enzyme. These intolerant people, after interacting with someone with the aforementioned enzyme, will exhibit symptoms smilier to allergies. This could be one of those cases.”</p>

<p>“You mean—humans can be allergic to each other?” Anita whispered.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a bit of an oversimplification. But for most intents and purposes…yes, it presents like allergies.”</p>

<p>“But—what do they do if this happens?” Bill said, glancing at Anita.</p>

<p>Dr. Brenner shrugged. “Avoid prolonged contact with any enzyme-producers. People with an A-35 intolerance can tolerate short exposures, but not prolonged, intense exposure, such as living with someone who secretes the A-35 enzyme.” The doctor’s eyes flittered to Anita’s, who was holding her breath. “Or people can continue with the steroid regimen, but I recommend against such an action due to the long-term side effects.”</p>

<p>Bill slouched in his seat, staring at his hands, which lay over his paunch.</p>

<p>“Will you test for it?” Anita whispered.</p>

<p>When nobody moved, Anita thought that nobody had heard her. After a moment, Dr Brennan opened a desk drawer with a sharp click that made Anita jump. “I can test you for the enzyme right now, but we’ll need to test Mr. Daniel’s blood sample for A-35 intolerance.” She held up a swath of paper and an eye dropper bottle. “Ms. Morrison, it’s a simple swab test to see if you are an A-35 enzyme producer,” Dr. Brenner said, nodding at Anita. “Please put out your hand.”</p>

<p>Anita hesitated, then closed her eyes before she extended her hand, then opened her eyes to watch Dr. Brenner squeeze liquid from an eye dropper bottle onto the paper. With a motion so swift that Anita barely felt anything, Dr. Brenner wiped Anita’s hand with the wet strip and then waited. Everyone watched as the paper strip slowly turned deep blue. Dr. Brenner nodded. “Yes, you’re positive for the A-35 enzyme. Now we just need to test Mr. Daniel’s blood.”</p>

<p>Bill sat there, staring at the blue tip of the paper. “So—I’m allergic to Anita?”</p>

<p>“It’s more of an intolerance than an allergy and we don’t know that for sure, Mr. Daniels. I’ll have the results in a few days.” Dr. Brenner glanced at the clock and rose to her feet. “Thank you for coming in. My office will call you within two business days.”</p>

<p>Anita didn’t feel Dr. Brenner gripping her hand in an overly firm handshake, nor did she feel her feet as she walked into the elevator. Bill and Anita stood at the opposite ends of the elevator in silence. Anita kept her eyes fixed on screen that counted down the floors, pretending she didn’t notice Bill leaning away from her.</p>

<hr />

<p>“I need to go to work. Big project due soon,” Bill said as soon as they entered the apartment. He grabbed his bag and was gone as quickly as he’d come. Anita stood at the entryway, the keys still dangling from her finger. The keys slid out of her hand and clinked as they hit the floor. Anita swayed a little before she braced herself with a chair. She hadn’t realized it, but she had been holding her breath ever since Bill left. Her face flushed as she gasped for breath.</p>

<p>“He’s not allergic to me,” Anita whispered to herself over and over again. After fifteen minutes of insisting that Bill did not have an A-35 intolerance, Anita inhaled and started to fold the laundry.</p>

<p>Anita lay in bed, staring into the blackness as the clock said one-fifteen in the morning. She listened to Bill’s soft footsteps in the living room then she heard the loveseat squeak as Bill climbed onto it. Anita never heard the bedroom door open that night, or the next two nights.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Hello,” Bill said into the phone. Anita stood in the kitchen and turned off the water so she could hear. “Yes, I’m William Daniels. Do you have the results?” He paused. “Hmm-mm. I see. Was it confirmed then?” Then there was a longer pause and Anita could only hear faint buzzing noises from the phone as Bill had turned his back to her. “Okay, okay. Thanks for calling.”</p>

<p>Anita squeezed the dishrag in her hands harder. “So, what did they say?” Anita wished that her voice hadn’t gotten so high-pitched, but it was too late.</p>

<p>Bill glanced at her, but stayed in the far corner of the living room. “I’m positive for the A-35 intolerance.”</p>

<p>Anita blinked rapidly. “Oh,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Bill stood in the corner of the living room, wedged between a chair and the loveseat, the furthest possible point from her that was still in the apartment. Anita just stared at him, feeling her chest rise and fall as she focused on her breathing.</p>

<p>The man in front of her looked like a stranger, not the man that she had dated for three and half years, nor was he the man that she had made promises to. Anita squeezed her eyes shut, hoping to find the old Bill when she opened her eyes. She didn’t. Instead of the smiling, carefree brown-haired man who liked to play basketball on weekends and discussed philosophy as easily as he talked about reality television, Anita saw a sallow, paunchy man who only chased promotions, not basketballs, and never read books.</p>

<p>Anita turned to the sink and started to scrub the pans that she had already cleaned. “Anita…“ Bill said, but his words faded away.</p>

<p>Exhaling and inhaling in rapid succession, Anita stared at a smudge on the pan. “I’ll move out by the end of the week,” Anita said, her own words sounding distant and tinny.</p>

<p>“Anita—damn it,” Bill said. “I—”</p>

<p>Anita waved him off. “It’s okay. It’s fine. It’s—well, we weren’t meant to be.” She giggled a little.</p>

<p>“Anita…”</p>

<p>Silence settled between them. Anita wondered if he would offer to keep on taking the steroids for her. She knew he wouldn’t and she knew that she wouldn’t let him.</p>

<p>Drying her hands, Anita blinked, trying to cool the burning behind her eyes. “It’s fine. I don’t have much. I’ll be out by Friday.”</p>

<p>Bill looked up. “But I don’t—I don’t want to do this like this.”</p>

<p>Anita clenched her hands. Something in her was fraying and she didn’t want Bill to see it snap. “There’s no choice is there?” she snapped.</p>

<p>“Maybe I should leave.”</p>

<p>“I can’t afford the rent here. I may as well leave now.” Anita turned into the bedroom. Before she closed the door, she heard Bill say, “I’ll stay with John until after—”</p>

<p>Anita clicked the bedroom door shut and held her breath. She didn’t release her breath until she heard the front door close. Finally, Anita crawled under the covers, fighting the sobs that wanted to be released. Finally, with the blankets all around her, she allowed the sobs to rise up from her chest. The sobs wracked her lungs, making them ache. Once the sobs receded into hiccups and wheezes, Anita sat up and felt the stillness around her.</p>

<p>“Damn you, Bill! Only if you weren’t allergic!” Anita screamed into the empty apartment. Then she whispered, “Damn me.”</p>

<p>Anita twisted the thin ring with the cubic zirconium off her finger and threw it on the floor. It shimmered under the overhead light, lying in a corner surrounded by dust mites and crumpled pieces of paper. Grunting, Anita crawled on the floor, picked up the ring and put it in her pocket.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, four months later, Anita stood on the sidewalk, staring at the empty windows—the windows she’d once stood behind. Everything about the windows was just like she remembered: the translucent white curtains, white borders of the glass and the wide windowsill.</p>

<p>John told her that Bill fumigated the apartment to get rid of all traces of the A-35 enzyme. Anita’s chest felt tight and raw, either from the wind or everything else. As the sun sank past the buildings, the wind blew harder and colder, making Anita’s nose run.</p>

<p>A light flickered on somewhere in the apartment, illuminating the window. A tall shadow appeared in front of the light, Bill’s shadow. The shoulder stoop and paunch were gone. Bill Daniels now stood as tall and trim as before. Anita could almost see him smiling. He was all right; Anita told herself.</p>

<p>Anita gathered her coat’s collar at her neck and was about to turn away to go home. Another shadow appeared next to Bill’s. It was a smaller, feminine shadow. Anita let go of her collar, letting the cold seep in. Bill’s shadow bent down and the shadows became one.</p>

<p>Anita almost stumbled back onto a small poodle, who yipped at her. “I’m sorry, I—” she mumbled to the dog’s owner.</p>

<p>“Watch it!” the owner hissed as she walked away, dragging the dog along with her.</p>

<p>Anita’s eyes returned to the window, the two shadows were still one. Finally, they separated and disappeared into the apartment. Getting colder by the minute, Anita stood there long after the shadows had disappeared.</p>

<p>Finally, Anita started to walk. “He’s okay now,” she whispered, letting the wind carry the words away.</p>

<p>With a sharp inhale, Anita kept walking down the street. The orange streetlights flickered on as she turned the corner. As she crossed the street, she opened her hand, letting a small, shiny ring fall into a storm drain.</p>
